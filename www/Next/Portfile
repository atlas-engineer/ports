notes "
Before using Next, please make sure that D-Bus is running. To launch
D-Bus you may have to execute `port load dbus`. This is because Next
relies on D-Bus to facilitate communication between the Lisp core and
the web view that you see on your screen.

Please find the Next.app in your /Applications folder.
