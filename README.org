* Ports
A collection of portfiles specific to Atlas.

* Usage
1. Clone this repository to a path of your choosing.
2. Edit your =/opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf= file to include a
   link to the location of this repository on your disk.
   + As an example, if you had cloned this repository to
     =/var/local/ports= you would add a line above the default source
     in =sources.conf= with the following syntax:
     =file:///var/local/ports=
3. Within the ports tree (this repository) execute =sudo portindex= to
   recreate the port tree index.
4. After setting up your new source, you will need to execute: =sudo
   port selfupdate= for MacPorts to update its sources.

Your set-up is now complete and you can install ports from this ports
tree! When a port is not found in this ports tree, it will fallback to
the default MacPorts official source.
